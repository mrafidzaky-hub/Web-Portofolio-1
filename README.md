# Web-Portofolio-1
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. The portfolio is designed to showcase my web development skills, projects, and professional experience. It provides an easy-to-navigate and visually appealing introduction to who I am, my work, and how to contact me. This portfolio is part of my journey in learning to become a full-stack developer. Next, I will continue my studies on JavaScript in more depth and create additional portfolios :rocket:
